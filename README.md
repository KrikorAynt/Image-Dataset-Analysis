Scripts Written during volunteering at YerevaNN and tested using FMoW dataset or CDD dataset

These scripts are all made for the purpose of analyzing a large image dataset.

dataset_jsonify takes in all available information from a dataset of images and puts all the metadata into a json file.
This is easily adaptable to all image datasets as it gathers the information from the files themselves or can be adapted to look for 
information files that provide more data.

json_mapify uses the json generated by dataset_jsonify to plot the locations of the files on a dynamic map webpage.This of course requires
there to be location data in the json.

dataset_analyzer collects and condenses information about a dataset to provide information such as total pixels, number of images
and more. It can either put this information in a more detailed text file or provide it directly in the terminal.

resize_images simply creates new images with lower resolutions from images in a dataset to provide more resolution varience for 
change detection applications. Still being worked on to become more flexible with inputted datasets
